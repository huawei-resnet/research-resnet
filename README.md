Trying to find more optimal hyperparameters by implementation of Grid Search for ResNet20 model using a grid of hyperparameters (`epochs` and `optimizer`).

This work is based on [Coding Project 1](https://github.com/huawei-resnet/research-resnet/tree/develop).

## How to run
* Completed requred task with all needed comments for execution located at file: [GridSearch](https://github.com/huawei-resnet/research-resnet/blob/presa-code/GridSearch.ipynb)
* Just execute line by line to see result
* This is just a great example of hyperparameter tuning via Grid Search
